# Model Notes


This model is from the article:  
**Cooperation and Competition in the Evolution of ATP-Producing Pathways**

**Abstract:**   
Heterotrophic organisms generally face a trade-off between rate and yield of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. This trade-off may result in an
evolutionary dilemma, because cells with a higher rate but lower yield of ATP
production may gain a selective advantage when competing for shared energy
resources. Using an analysis of model simulations and biochemical
observations, we show that ATP production with a low rate and high yield can
be viewed as a form of cooperative resource use and may evolve in spatially
structured environments. Furthermore, we argue that the high ATP yield of
respiration may have facilitated the evolutionary transition from unicellular
to undifferentiated multicellular organisms.

  
**Note:**

This model reproduces the competition and invasion described in Supplemental
Figure 2.
